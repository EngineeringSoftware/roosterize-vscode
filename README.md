# Roosterize VSCoq Plugin

Roosterize is a tool for suggesting lemma names in verification
projects that use the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr).
The tool leverages neural networks that take serialized Coq
lemma statements and elaborated terms as input; see the [Technique](#Technique)
section below.

## Requirements

- [OCaml 4.07.1](https://ocaml.org)
- [SerAPI 0.7.1](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi)
- [Coq 8.10.2](https://coq.inria.fr/download)
- [Python 3.7.7+](https://www.python.org)
- [PyTorch 1.1.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v110)

## Installation and usage

### Installation of OCaml, Coq, and SerAPI

We strongly recommend installing the required versions of OCaml, Coq,
and SerAPI via the [OPAM package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org),
version 2.0.6 or later.

To set up the OPAM-based OCaml environment, use:
```
opam switch create 4.07.1
opam switch 4.07.1
eval $(opam env)
```
Then, install Coq and SerAPI, pinning them to avoid unintended upgrades:
```
opam update
opam pin add coq 8.10.2
opam pin add coq-serapi 8.10.0+0.7.1
```

### Installation of Python and PyTorch

We recommend installing the required versions of Python and PyTorch
using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Then, install PyTorch by following the instructions
[here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v110), using
the installation command suitable for your operating system, Python
package manager, and whether you want to use it on a CPU or GPU.

Next, either download a Roosterize [release][releases-link]
or clone the Roosterize repository and enter the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/roosterize.git
cd roosterize
```

To install other required Python libraries (`pip` is included with
Python installation):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download pre-trained models

We have trained several models using our [corpus][math-comp-corpus], which
follows the lemma naming conventions used in the [Mathematical Components][math-comp-website]
family of projects. The pre-trained models are available for separate [download][models-link].

Put the archive with the models (`models.tgz`) in the Roosterize root
directory, and then uncompress it:
```
tar xzf models.tgz
```

[models-link]: https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/roosterize/releases/download/v8.10.0/models.tgz

### Usage

To use Roosterize on a Coq verification project, you need to first
build and install the project with the command provided by the project
(usually `make` followed by `make install`). Then, at the root directory of
the project repository, run the command
```
python -m roosterize.main suggest_lemmas \
 --project=$PATH_TO_PROJECT \
 --serapi_options=$SERAPI_OPTIONS \
 --model-dir=./models/roosterize-ta \
 --output=./output
```
where `$PATH_TO_PROJECT` should be replaced with the path to the
project, and `$SERAPI_OPTIONS` should be replaced with the SerAPI
command line options for mapping logical paths to directories (see [SerAPI's
documentation](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi/blob/v8.11/FAQ.md#does-serapi-support-coqs-command-line-flags)).
For example, if the logical path (inside Coq) for the project is `Verified`,
you should set `SERAPI_OPTIONS="-R $PATH_TO_PROJECT,Verified"`.

The command extracts all lemmas from the project, uses Roosterize's
pre-trained model (at `./models/roosterize-ta`) to predict a lemma name
for each lemma, and finally prints the lemma name update suggestions,
i.e., the predicted lemma names that are different from to the existing ones.
Below is an example of printed suggestions:
```
>>>>> Suggestions:
infotheo/ecc_classic/bch.v: infotheo.ecc_classic.bch.BCH.BCH_PCM_altP1 -> inde_F2
infotheo/ecc_classic/bch.v: infotheo.ecc_classic.bch.BCH.BCH_PCM_altP2 -> inde_mul
infotheo/ecc_classic/bch.v: infotheo.ecc_classic.bch.BCH.PCM_altP -> F2_eq0
...
```

For other usages and command line interfaces of Roosterize, please
check the help:
```
python -m roosterize.main help
```

## Technique

Roosterize learns and suggests lemma names using neural networks
that take serialized Coq lemma statements and elaborated terms as input.
For example, the Coq lemma sentence
```coq
Lemma mg_eq_proof L1 L2 (N1 : mgClassifier L1) : L1 =i L2 -> nerode L2 N1.
```
is serialized into the following tokens (simplified):
```lisp
(Sentence((IDENT Lemma)(IDENT mg_eq_proof)(IDENT L1)(IDENT L2)
  (KEYWORD"(")(IDENT N1)(KEYWORD :)(IDENT mgClassifier)
  (IDENT L1)(KEYWORD")")(KEYWORD :)(IDENT L1)(KEYWORD =i)(IDENT L2)
  (KEYWORD ->)(IDENT nerode)(IDENT L2)(IDENT N1)(KEYWORD .)))
```
and the corresponding elaborated term (simplified):
```lisp
(Prod (Name (Id char)) ... (Prod (Name (Id L1)) ...
 (Prod (Name (Id L2)) ... (Prod (Name (Id N1)) ...
  (Prod Anonymous (App (Ref (DirPath ((Id ssrbool) (Id ssr) (Id Coq))) (Id eq_mem)) ...
   (Var (Id L1)) ... (Var (Id L2)))
  (App (Ref (DirPath ((Id myhill_nerode) (Id RegLang))) (Id nerode)) ...
   (Var (Id L2)) ... (Var (Id N1))))))))
```

architecture, as applied to this example:

Our [research paper][arxiv-paper] outlines the design of Roosterize,
and describes an evaluation on a [corpus][math-comp-corpus]
of serialized Coq code derived from the [Mathematical Components][math-comp-website]
family of projects. The training, validation, and testing sets of Coq files from the corpus
used in the evaluation are defined in the `training` directory.
